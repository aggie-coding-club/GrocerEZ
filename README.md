# About
GrocerEZ is a mobile app that uses a combination of web-scraping and 
crowd-sourcing to determine which store could fulfill your grocery list 
for the cheapest total

# Installation
To download the repository on your computer, run `git clone https://github.com/aggie-coding-club/GrocerEZ`

# Getting Started
To get ready to run the frontend, download the Expo app on your phone. On your computer, run the
following series of commands:
```
cd GrocerEZ
cd frontend
npm install
npm install -g expo-cli
```

You only have to install the dependencies once. After that, you can just run `expo start` to start
building the app. Once the app is built, a QR code should show up on your screen. Scan this code
with the Expo app to open the app on your phone. You might need to toggle between the tunnel, LAN,
and local options if it doesn't connect on the first try.
